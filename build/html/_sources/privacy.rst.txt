Privacy Notice
==============

Introduction
------------

Privacy matters to us because we know you may consider your data to be sensitive, and that means it's sensitive 
to us as well. We do, which is why we encrypt all data stored in our databases with industry standard mechanisms.

This notice applies to the service provided on the Fireanote_ website, including any 
messages incoming from your applications and services, subscriptions, and any identifying personal or company data used to use the service.

Data Protection
---------------

We have responsibilities as a data controller under the Data  Protection Acts 1998, 2003 and General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR)  to protect client data.

We will comply with data protection law. This says that the personal information we hold about you must be used lawfully, 
fairly and in a transparent way, and collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to  you and not 
used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes, relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited 
only to those purposes, accurate and kept up to date, kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you 
about, and kept securely.

These include to keep the data only for specified and lawful purposes, keep it safe and secure, and retain it no 
longer than necessary. Normally the service will retain your data for a configurable and short period of time, and 
then destroy the data. 

Data in the form of notifications passed from your applications and services are not retained after being relayed to 
your specified destinations. Codejago reserves the right to use analytics to process incoming data, without any reference 
or connection to individuals or legal entities, for the purposes of generating reports and insights of value to you.

Read the policy carefully and contact us with any questions or concerns about our privacy practices.

Who we are

Our Data Protection Officer can be contacted at::

    Codejago Ltd.
    34 Gleann na Ri, 
    Druid Valley,
    Cabinteely, 
    Dublin 18.

or via dataprotection@codejago.com.

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Data  Protection Commissioner's Office (DPC), the Irish supervisory 
authority  for data protection issues (www.dataprotection.ie). We would, however,  appreciate the chance to deal with your 
concerns before you approach the DPC so please contact us in the first instance.

What information do we collect?
-------------------------------

Personal data is any information about an individual from which that  individual can be identified.  Your name, address, 
phone number and bank account number are examples of personal data.  It does not include data where the identity has been 
removed (anonymous data).  

We collect a minimum set of personal data or data pertaining to a legal entity that would be required to generate an identifying 
user account.

User profiles
-------------

Email address - We use this for notifications and updates on changes to your account.

Name - We use this to personalise the service, for instance to address you in email communications.

Marketing
---------

Where you have explicitly consented to do so, we may use your personal data to inform you of new information that we believe 
may be of interest to you; and/or if you would prefer that we do not send such communications to you, please follow the opt-out 
links on any marketing message.

When we may share your data
---------------------------

We may share your personal information with other third parties in the context of the possible sale of our business. We may 
also need to share your personal data in order to permit us to pursue available  remedies or limit damages we may sustain.

Transfer of your personal data to other countries
-------------------------------------------------

As we are providing an international service, we may need to transfer the  personal data you provide to us to other countries 
which may be outside  the European Economic Area (EEA). The data protection laws in such countries may not be as comprehensive 
and provide the same level of protection for your personal data as those  within the EEA. In these circumstances, we will take 
appropriate steps to ensure that your personal data is handled as described in this  Privacy Notice.  

The security of your personal data
----------------------------------

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an  
unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees who have a 
legitimate need to know. They are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

Our storage and retention of your personal data
------------------------------------------------

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. You may delete your 
account at any time from functionality provided within the service. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so 
that it can  no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such  information without further notice to you. 

Your rights as a data subject
-----------------------------

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data  subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of 
the  personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully  processing it.

Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This  enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information 
we hold  about you corrected.

Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to  delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason 
for us  continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or  remove your personal data where you have exercised 
your right to object  to processing (see below).

Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a  legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is 
something  about your particular situation which makes you want to object to  processing on this ground. You also have the right to 
object where we  are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.

Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This  enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about  
you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason  for processing it.

Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.

If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your  personal data, object to the processing of your personal data, or  
request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another  party, please contact us using the contact details in this 
Privacy  Notice.

No fee usually required
-----------------------

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to  exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a 
reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive.  Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the 
request in such  circumstances.

What we may need from you
-------------------------

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm  your identity and ensure your right to access the information 
(or to  exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security  measure to ensure that personal information is not 
disclosed to any  person who has no right to receive it.

Your right to withdraw consent
------------------------------

In circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the  collection, processing and transfer of your personal data for a 
specific  purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific  processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, 
please contact us  using the contact details in this Privacy Notice. Once we have received  notification that you have withdrawn your 
consent, we will no longer  process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally  agreed to, unless we have another 
legitimate basis for doing so in law.

Changes to this Privacy Notice
------------------------------

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Notice at any time,  and we will provide you with a new Privacy Notice when we make any  
substantial updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to  time about the processing of your personal information.
