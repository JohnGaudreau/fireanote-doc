Welcome to Fireanote
====================

Fireanote_ is a simple notification system 
for your apps. Integration is a snap with a single call to a single URI.

Let's imagine you have an Android app and it encountered an unknown 
scenario and threw an exception. For many this error never leaves the 
app instance on that phone and the only thing that leaves is the 
customer, perhaps with unfairly negative feedback imprinted forever 
on the app store.

Fireanote_ will allow you to wrap those errors up as messages and 
receive them as emails so you can respond in a timely and supernaturally 
preemptive fashion.

All notifications are destroyed after a short period and nothing is stored.

Having said that there are some bells-n-whistles if you so wish, such as 
increased capacity, or sentiment analysis.
