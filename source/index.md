# Fireanote

[Fireanote](https://www.fireanote.com) is a simple notification system for your apps. Integration is a snap with a single call to a single URI.

Let's imagine you have an Android app and it encountered an unknown scenario and threw an exception. For many this error never leaves the app instance on that phone and the only thing that leaves is the customer, perhaps with unfairly negative feedback imprinted forever on the app store.

[Fireanote](https://www.fireanote.com) will allow you to wrap those errors up as messages and receive them as emails so you can respond in a timely and supernaturally preemptive fashion.

All notifications are destroyed after a short period and nothing is stored.

Having said that there are some bells-n-whistles if you so wish, such as increased capacity, or sentiment analysis.
